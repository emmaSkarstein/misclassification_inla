This supporting information contains all the PDF-documents containing the code to reproduce the results in the examples in the paper, along with some additional examples. The subsections are:

- Simulation study: Adjusting for covariate misclassification: Two examples of covariate misclassification in linear regression, along with a simulation study repeating the second example. Described in Section 5.1.
- Covariate misclassification from a latent Gaussian variable with measurement error: A simulated example of how dichotomizing a continuous variable with error leads to misclassification, presented in Section 5.2.
- Missing observations in a binary covariate: A simulated example with missing observations, presented in Section 5.3.
- Adjusting for response misclassification with the sslogit link: A simulated example of how to deal with response misclassification in INLA, described in Section 5.4.
- Birth weight analysis: The birthweight example presented in Section 6.1
- Cervical cancer and herpes: The cervical cancer case-control study example presented in Section 6.2


Some of the files use functions and data sets from the R package `inlamisclass`, which is available to download from GitHub:
